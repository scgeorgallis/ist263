        Hi! I am an Innovation, Society, and Technology major and I want pursue a career in the music technology, specifically in music production and sharing platforms (think Spotify)! 
        Some of my current accomplishments are that I am the Student Show Coordinator for University Union, I work on magazines on campus and help film students with set design, and that I interned in LA this past summer at a music management company (Red Light Management)
        I’m skilled in event planning, styling, project management/excel, digital marketing, data visualization and research, and creative direction! 
        Outside of school I love to read, listen to music and go to concerts, hang out with my friends, thrift, go surfing during the summer! I’ve recently gotten into photography and want to learn how to produce music. Currently, I’m watching Shameless for the 3rd time. My favorite color is red and I’ve had my nails painted that color since I was 14. I am also a huge coffee drinker!
