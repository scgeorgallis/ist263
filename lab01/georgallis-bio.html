        Work on magazines on campus and help film students with set design!
        
        I’m skilled in graphic design, branding, creative direction, and data visualization!
        Outside of school I love to read, collage and scrapbook, dance with friends, listen to music, and shop! My favorite shows ever are Pretty Little Liars and Shameless - I’ve watched both AT LEAST 3 times. I love love love fashion and expressing myself through art and my clothes. Plus, something random is that I am always drinking coffee. Like I love it so MUCH. It’s my favorite drink in the world and I have been drinking coffee avidly since I was a freshmen in high school!
